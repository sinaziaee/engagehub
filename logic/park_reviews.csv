Riley Park,Patrina M,4,"Love this park, we visited while in Calgary. Awesome for kids of all ages, you can picnic, swim or play on sldes just to name a few.  There are also benches and lifeguards on duty. The changing rooms and washrooms were also clean.

No dogs are allowed, the place is also well maintained, with free parking on Sundays and holidays. That's always a welcomed plus.

This is somewhere i will definately visit again."
Riley Park,Bharat Raj Verma,5,"Great Park near downtown.
Has 2 cricket pitches, wading pool, kids play area and many picnic tables.
Full of flower bed in Summers. Kids playground ans jogging track."
Riley Park,Colette Pelletier,4,"A beautiful walk in the summer, great bike paths, and amazing view in the winter months. I watched the sunrise in the winter leaving work on my night shift. The full moon was amazing as I heard to work."
Riley Park,Bharat Shah,5,"This is a beautiful park in the vicinity of downtown, Calgary. It has plenty of trees, grassy ground, benches to enjoy shade or sun, and a paved trail to enjoy walking, jogging, or cycling.
The park has a children play ground with lots of equipment to amuse children of diverse interests, and It is always buzzling with children.
The park has a city and district cricket league established in 1908, a well-built pitch, net practice area, and a lot of cricketers of different age groups and genders exercising, stretching, running, practicing, or playing tournament matches. The league has many teams, and anyone can join a team and practice or play there.
The park is popular for its wadding pool for all ages of people. Currently it is closed to the public. I have never wadded in a pool, so I look forward to visit the park once the pool is made available to the public.
Street parking is available on the streets for which you have to pay, but after 6:00 pm and on Sundays, you may park for free.
I cannot agree more with one of the reviewers who said this park was an oasis."
Riley Park,Vian Esterhuizen,5,It's a really nice park. I'm surprised it's not more popular. Great field areas for soccer and Frisbee etc. Beautiful old trees. Beautiful flower beds. Really close to a bunch of shops and restaurants in Kensington. Playground one end.
Prince's Island Park,Dragos Nina,5,It's such a beautiful park. Flower arrangements were very creative. The trees are great. Kids' play structure is newer and a lot of fun. The new black squirrels were neat to see for the first time. Only down side was the men's washroom. Two of the toilets were completely disgusting. The place needs an upgrade badly.
Prince's Island Park,Amy Kim,5,"This is one of our favorite parks to visit. It’s so chill and natural. Walking among the trees, watching the animals, and seeing the children running around brings us so much joy and relief. A perfect place to unwind."
Prince's Island Park,Jon Cole,5,"Super nice quiet park in the heart of downtown. Lots of space, large trees, benches, flower gardens. With the river on both sides it really is a quiet area. Everyone at the park is doing the same thing - just enjoying.
Can be super busy on summer weekends or holidays. So bicycling can be a slow process because of the crowds!"
Prince's Island Park,John William Wade,5,"Came here for Folk Fest and it did not disappoint! It is an amazing venue to hold such a popular festival. There are multiple stages with remarkably good sound systems and plenty of natural grass to sit on.

The breeze from the river sure is welcome under the hot sun 🌞

There is a great big children's playground here that is quite popular. The benches around it are perfect for parents to sit at while letting their kids burn off their energy.

In the Spring there are plenty of Canada geese that nest  🪺 and prepare their goslings for life outside the nest. With all of the natural beauty it is a great escape from the urban jungle just across the bridge."
Prince's Island Park,Monish,5,"Prince's Island Park, nestled in the heart of downtown Calgary, is a serene oasis that offers a welcome escape from the bustling city streets. Located on an island in the Bow River, this picturesque park is a favorite among locals and visitors alike for its natural beauty, recreational opportunities, and cultural attractions.

Walking through Prince's Island Park, I was immediately struck by its peaceful ambiance and scenic views. The park's lush green spaces, mature trees, and flower gardens create a tranquil setting ideal for picnics, leisurely strolls, or simply unwinding amidst nature.

One of the park's highlights is its network of pathways and trails that meander along the riverbanks and through wooded areas, providing opportunities for walking, jogging, and cycling. It's a perfect place to reconnect with nature while enjoying views of the river and Calgary's skyline in the distance.

Throughout the summer months, Prince's Island Park comes alive with vibrant festivals, outdoor concerts, and cultural events. The park's amphitheater hosts performances ranging from live music to theater productions, drawing crowds from across the city to gather and celebrate.

For art enthusiasts, the park is home to the acclaimed Eau Claire Market, where local artists showcase their work in outdoor galleries. It's a cultural hub that reflects Calgary's creative spirit and provides a platform for artists to engage with the community.

Whether you're seeking a peaceful retreat in nature, attending a lively festival, or exploring local art, Prince's Island Park offers something for everyone to enjoy. It's a beloved urban sanctuary that captures the essence of Calgary's vibrant lifestyle and natural beauty."

Confederation Park,Wynter YYC,5,"This park is lovely. It winds along a small creek, lined with trees. Each time I visit, it's different. People walk, jog and dog-walk along the paved pathway. It runs from the cemetery on the east side of the park to the golf course on the west side. It's particularly beautiful in the fall when the leaves change colour."
Confederation Park,Sara Rylott,5,"This is such a lovely park. So many places to stop and sit or have a picnic. There were lots of families but it is so huge everyone had lots of space. Trails were all paved so great for bikes, rollerblading and strollers. We were staying near the university and we will definitely be going back for a lovely nature walk."
Confederation Park,No longer using,5,"This is one of the most beautiful city parks I have ever seen.  Amazing paved trails, beautiful bridges and water ways.  Baseball diamonds, playgrounds for children, areas to BBQ, the tunnel was fun and the grass perfectly kept.  We didn't even scratch the surface.  We will definitely be back."
Confederation Park,hiren gondaliya,5,"The park is facilitated with all facilities which are essential for recreational activities. Walkways, barbecues playgrounds for children and adults, parking and seating spaces are available for all ages."
Nose Hill Park,Jeremiah Hunter,4,"Started coming here more regularly the last six months. I generally enter through the Winter Club Parking Lot entrance. They have a bathroom and a porta potty in the parking lot. There aren't many rubbish bins throughout the park. There is generally one at each entrance and I've found one more on the south side of the park at the top of the hill about halfway through as you walk west to east. About half of the park is dog friendly and off leash. I find that most of the owners that take their dogs here have dogs that are less socialized and so are wary of other dogs - but there's so much space that you can avoid most dogs if yours isn't that social.
It takes me about three hours to walk the perimeter of the off leash area with my dog and maybe an hour to walk through the middle from one side to the other (depending which way you go).
During the summer occasionally there's a small natural pool of water somewhere in the middle of the park, but otherwise there isn't running water here for your dog.
Also note that once you reach the top plain of the park it can get very windy.
There are some benches through the park but not many places to sit if you need a break."
Nose Hill Park,Scott R,5,"It's a wonderful park right on the edge of the city. No missed in sight tho.

..We absolutely loved walking the endless amount of trails and a very nice place to visit."
Nose Hill Park,Braedon Van Gorkom,5,"Huge park with walking and biking paths throughout. This park is mostly prairie, however, there are numerous treed gullies.  There are both paved, dirt and grass trails, with major paths having good signage. Cyclists will enjoy the endless descents, some of which are quite steep. A mountain bike is recommended.  The park can get quite windy, as it is very exposed. There are some incredible views, particularly to the South and West. There are some interesting places to visit (such as the medicine wheel to the south of the park) and a number of glacial erratics strewn about."
Nose Hill Park,Kevin Wang,5,"Gorgeous park with panoramic views over the city including downtown Calgary.

There’s a variety of trails from more technical mountain biking ones to easy gravel options. There’s multiple places of interest to stop including a rock maze, Glacier hill, rocks, ponds, etc.

Most trails are unshaded and requires uphill walking from the parking lot"
Nose Hill Park,Micah Leganchuk,5,"Tons of trails, beautiful colors in the fall, some hidden treasures (archaeological indigenous history)to find that are apparently 1000’s of years old, an off leash dog park(dog must stay in leash till you find the off leash area-well marked), and just a great way to get out of the city within the city."
McHugh Bluff,Nagendra HS Rao,5,Ideal spot if you are looking for a fall trip within the city of Calgary. McHugh bluff also known as Crescent Heights lookout runs down to connect with Prince's Island Park. Wooden stairs connects Crescent Heights to the Park over the bridge. Lots of trees welcome the visitors for the fall season across the bow river. Stroller accessible but that could not connect Crescent Heights to the park because you can't use stroller in the stairs. Parking at Crescent Heights is free. It is good idea to park here and walk. Free entry at both ends (Crescent Heights and Prince's Island Park).
McHugh Bluff,Matt Zhang,5,Amazing place to have a casual walking and enjoy the beautiful view of downtown
McHugh Bluff,Sherry C.,4,"Nice view. However, the road was not in good condition. When cyclists raised dust on the way up (no photo here), we had to choose a very steep dirt road to climb."
McHugh Bluff,Fai Chanthicha,5,Best place to see downtown Calgary! Autumn spot.
McHugh Bluff,Yaroslav Khudych,5,"Hands down one of the best views of the downtown, and the best place for sunsets!
If you're a photographer I highly recommend this location. At night the city skyline is lit up with thousands of lights and looks spectacular."
Pearce Estate Park,Lisa Chan,5,"Great park with free parking and overflow parking.  Civic Long weekend, it was super busy.  People were ticketed for parking in a no-parking zone.   Some BBQ pits but a lot of people tale gated or brought their own cookware and tents for summer fun.  A couple of minutes walk to Bow Habitat Station and wetland Interpretative Centre and less than five minutes walk to Harvie’s Passage  for swimming, kayaking, floating or waddling in the summer heat.  Super fun highly recommend for a visit.  Go for a walk or bring your bikes as there are both paved and unpaved pathways.  The Calgary parks and pathways are great!"
Pearce Estate Park,Andrea Tokessy,5,"Situated adjacent the Bow river where one can swim or go kayaking and boating, weather permitting, of course. Beautiful walking paths and off path walking. Dogs are permitted on leash. There is a good children's playground. Plenty of picnic tables,
and of course there are facilities."
Pearce Estate Park,Alsina Butt,4,"Marshy wetland, beautiful nature walk, but make sure you bring mosquito repellant.
Beautiful park with water sounds and peaceful.
Planning to go again to BBQ
Really enjoyed walking, saw people kayaking, riding bicycles, jogging"
Pearce Estate Park,Jaz Ramgarhia,5,An amazing place to explore so take your water and snacks. Lots and lots of little pathways. If you like to chill right next to river water this is a place to be. We came across so much nature on our walk. Good memories. 👍🏼🙏🏻
Pearce Estate Park,Kip G,5,"Great little park, access to bow River.
Marshes, walking trails, public washrooms, free parking (although can get very busy)."
Edworthy Park,Emmy,3,"It's a huge park, but the area our GPS took us seemed like it took forever/ was convoluted.
Lots of open space. We seemed to be at the off leash dog park, which was fine because we love dogs. But we didn't have our furry friend with us at the time.  Lots of paths and such. No paved areas. There were several benches in one area to have a rest. Beautiful view of parts of the city, especially with fall colour's."
Edworthy Park,Ryan Seibel,5,"Is your dog wound up and in need of some exercise? Edworthy Park is the perfect spot to let em unwind! It’s my go-to off-leash dog walking destination in the city. The people are friendly, the dogs are happy, and the views are stunning. At times, it feels like you’re miles away from the city, especially on the east side of the park among the trees.

You can park in the first lot as you enter and enjoy pathways that extend all the way to the third parking lot. If you prefer not to stick to pathways, the main area usually has plenty of dogs for yours to socialize with.

The only drawback? There are no washrooms! So if nature calls, just remember: it’s not just your dog that might need to answer!"
Edworthy Park,phoenix invest,5,"Amazing park! Family friendly and you can bring your pets. Built in charcoal bbq's, benches and playground. Spacious for partying. Outhouses by the parking lot but it was getting kinda full."
Edworthy Park,Serafina Montefresco-White (Olivia Prior),5,Came here on a field trip for work. The park is beautiful and a very nice place to be. We hiked up one of the trails to the top of the hill and wandered around the forested areas. There’s a small stream/creek as well. They have porta potties but I believe this is only temporary as someone else told me that they do have actual washrooms. There’s also a huge new playground and picnic tables with mini bbqs. Overall a great place for family/friend/work outings!
Edworthy Park,Rakshit Narayanan Devaraj Baskar,5,"Very nice place to visit, relax, take a walk, hike, bike or go with a group have picnics, barbecues and have a superb time. The Bow river flows bordering the park, which is absolutely great to get our feet wet, have a nice dip in hot weather and such. 😊
Very family friendly, must visit atleast once. The place is accessible by transit, has goo connectivity to bike paths and is right next to major roads. Recommend it for sure! 😃"
West Confederation Park,lionel isiaka,5,"I recently spent a delightful afternoon at the West Confederation Park Splash Park in Calgary, and it was an exceptional experience! This splash park is a hidden gem, perfect for families and individuals looking for a refreshing retreat on a hot day.

The park features an array of water activities, from playful splash pads and fountains to interactive water sprays. The design is thoughtful, ensuring that children of various ages can find something fun and engaging. My kids particularly enjoyed the water cannons and the large splash bucket that tips over intermittently.

The cleanliness of the park is commendable, with well-maintained facilities and plenty of garbage bins to keep the area tidy. There are numerous shaded seating areas and picnic spots, making it a great place to bring a lunch and spend several hours.

What sets West Confederation Park apart is its beautiful surrounding greenery. The park is nestled in a serene, tree-lined area, providing a pleasant ambiance and a bit of natural shade. There are also walking paths and playgrounds nearby, offering additional activities for the whole family.

The staff was friendly and helpful, ensuring that the water features were in good working order and that everyone was enjoying their time safely.

In summary, the West Confederation Park Splash Park is a fantastic destination for a fun-filled day out. Whether you're a local or just visiting Calgary, this park is well worth a visit. Highly recommended for its cleanliness, variety of activities, and beautiful setting!"
West Confederation Park,James Cruickshank,5,""" Pump park"" we have been all over the city to other pump tracks and this one has the best design and curvature out of them all.  The far south one is too sharp if that makes sense. This one is nice and round.  Great spacing etc.  makes it perfect for beginners and advanced alike.  It's also possible for skateboarding and scooters .  There is some etiquette.  Keep space between you and the person Infront. Keep an eye out for little kids who are just learning.  Have fun!"
West Confederation Park,Colin Smith,5,"My favourite neighbourhood park! Beautiful trees, some wild grassland filled with wild roses. They say horses and buffalo used to water in the creek that flows through here. 🌸🍁🌾🌲🌳🌿"
West Confederation Park,Fateme Kazemi,5,"So beautiful at fall, if you like to see more I have a video in my YouTube channel: @kadiola it's all about beautiful Calgary🥰"
West Confederation Park,Zoe Eee,5,"Awesome splash park (has washrooms which is always clean) and tennis court for public use. Has access to bike paths connecting to Confederation park.
Only thing missing is a playground area and it would be perfect!
It's also not crowded so definitely a plus!"
Baker Park,Frölfênüügen 4 Lyfe,4,Baker Park has an excellent disc golf course on it. The disc golf course is good for beginners and intermediate players alike. The park sits along the Bow River in Calgary on the opposite side from the 1988 ski jumps. There's tons of walking paths and picnic areas with the river and ski jumps as a backdrop. It's beautifully landscaped and well maintained with public washrooms available as well.
Baker Park,Adam Scharnau,5,"Wonderful park with plenty of trees, great river views, and a disc golf course!"
Baker Park,Shelbie Lazell,5,Baker parks is absolutely beautiful at sunset. Over by one of the structure was a owls near . Definitely super cool to see. On the east side they have a large area for frisbee games.
Baker Park,Saania Zehra Jamal,5,"Can't believe I've lived here seven years and this is my first time visiting. The park is small but serene, clean, crowd-free and gorgeous views by the river. Truly an underrated gem in the NW and hope it stays that way."
Baker Park,JB,5,Great course! Can't wait to play it in the summer!
Prairie Winds Park,Varun Pandya,5,"Had the most amazing experience at the park, the view from the top of the hill is just wow. I would really just want you to take a stroll and a hike around the park, you will feel the beauty of nature around you. The kids play area near the main hill is also very good. It's just great 😃"
Prairie Winds Park,Rashda Khalid,5,"I love to visit this spacious park whenever I find leisure time. It's best for walking and jogging.  Kids also enjoy it. I will say, it's one of the best parks in Castleridge."
Prairie Winds Park,lionel isiaka,4,"Prairie Winds Park is a fantastic spot for a fun day out, especially with its excellent splash pad that kids absolutely love. The park is clean, well-maintained, and offers plenty of space for families to relax and play. However, the pool was closed during our visit, which was a bit disappointing, especially on a very hot day when we expected a lot of people. Despite this, the splash pad and other amenities still made it an enjoyable experience. Overall, a great place to cool off and have fun, but it would be even better if the pool were open."
Prairie Winds Park,T Win,4,"Very well-kept, multi-purpose and family friendly park.  There are tables/sites for BBQs/picnic,  calisthenics exercise bars, an art installation at the top of the hill, and kids play and pool areas.  Most of the paths are cement paved and smooth, great for strolling and jogging.  Lots of trees all around the park.  There is a building with a washroom."
Prairie Winds Park,Granden and Myra Bertrand,5,"We were only here for a short time, wow, what an amazing park. Cool large playground, cricket field, water park etc. Pathways are well maintained and you get a good view of the airport runway from the top of the hill. What a neat place. A little bit for almost everyone."
Carburn Park,tasha a,5,"August 2024

A beautiful location to go for a walk in the summertime. I have not been there any other time of the year. Lots of trails to travel on and lots of nature to see if you're lucky to see it.
I would recommend this park to everyone. You can walk in all in a short period of time. Would be great if it were bigger. It's also surprisingly quiet considering it's directly across from deer foot trail main road.
Overall, it's a great beautiful park that is worth seeing and exploring around by yourself, or with family and friends."
Carburn Park,Halina J. Beaulieu,5,"Very nice park, so much natural greenery. Great walking trails by the Bow river.
You can go for a nice walk or sit on the bench and relax."
Carburn Park,Leanne Taylor,5,"Summer time kayak and SUP, surrounded by birds of all kinds, cycle/walking paths, picnic areas and benches.  Today we brought our SUP and launched off 1 of 2 docks on the round-about lake.  There is another lake but no docks - readily accessible by any floating device.   Kayak rentals are available onsite and today there was a wood burning pizza oven food truck (delicious - bought 1!)   So much to do at this hidden gem; nestled along the Bow River and wildlife refuge area."
Carburn Park,Quynh Le,5,"Such's an amazing park. Feeling the beatiful Bow River, the nice lake and comfortably trail. An ideal location for all season, but Summer time is good and great place for kayaking, biking, BBQ, photoshoot some wildlife.. (We caught a deer 🥰) Peace at heart 🙏❤️"

Stanley Park,Ly C.,5,The parking lot has a clean washroom nearby. 25 min walk until Rideau Park Pedestrian bridge.  Large lawns. Playground. Table tennis. Some barbecue and picnic along the skating rink area (which has its own parking lot)
Stanley Park,Alexandra,5,"I recently visited Stanley Park and had a fantastic experience! One of the highlights was its proximity to the river, which provided beautiful scenic views and a serene atmosphere for a relaxing day out. The park also offers excellent amenities, including well-maintained tennis courts and an inviting outdoor pool. The $6 fee for access is quite reasonable considering the quality and range of facilities available. Overall, Stanley Park is a wonderful place for outdoor activities and enjoying nature. Highly recommended!"
Stanley Park,Jessica Jeong,5,"The park is very large, provides a perfect opportunity to witness the beautiful foliage, if you go in the autumn. In addition to the walking paths and the bike route circling the park by the sea, the scenery is self-evident. If you have the time, I highly recommend coming here for a half-day stroll and taking in the beauty of Vancouver. This time, I rented a bike to go around the park, and the ocean view and the beautiful maple leaves created a picturesque scene. After cycling around, I not only didn't feel tired, but my body and mind were very relaxed. One thing to note is that when cycling, whether stopping or starting, please be mindful of whether there are people behind you!"
Stanley Park,David Reeves,5,Beautiful park. Lots of baby geese now. A great place to spend some time with nature in our beautiful city.
Stanley Park,Denna Daneshvar,4,"Nice place if you wanna take sunbath and play in the shallow water, a bit busy at weekends"

Established in 1912, this historic park features elegant pathways, lush flower beds, a stunning central fountain, and the stately Memorial Park Library, one of the city’s most iconic heritage buildings. With its European-style gardens, seasonal blooms, and peaceful atmosphere, the park serves as a perfect spot for relaxation, reading, or a quiet stroll. A tribute to Canada’s veterans, it also houses several war memorials, making it both a scenic and meaningful destination."
Central Memorial Park,Kristi Herrmanowski,4,A lot of homeless were sleeping and hanging around on the benches. The water fountains were not on. Beautiful place surrounded by flowers. We took a quick peek inside the library.
Central Memorial Park,Victor Law,5,"What a nice park in downtown Calgary. We came for the 4th Street Night Market. The vendors were unique and interesting. The selection of food trucks was wide range, so there's something for everyone.

Parking is the biggest issue as it took us a couple of loops to find a spot."

Bowness Park,Sveta Kopylov,5,"An ideal destination for families and couples. You can enjoy a cup of coffee and ski across the expansive area or simply stroll through the park. Additionally, skiing equipment is available for rent, and a free ski helper is provided."
Bowness Park,miss_j,5,"Bowness Park has always been our favorite Fall spot. It's so beautiful that we keep coming back every year to do our yearly fall photos. It's also a great park during summer as there is a waterpark free for kids. Also, lots of people enjoy the bow river rafting with their own rafts or rental. Some people actually go swimming too, although I'm sure the water will be too cold. Winter is also beautiful as people can ice skate along the park. You can do a walking/biking  loop trail from here to Baker Park, which is very easy. You will have to pass a nice bridge that connects the river. Path is open all season. There is also a path at the end (close to the green bridge) going up to the community residential area. People walk or even bike going up there. It is now fully developed. There is a lot of squirrel in the area, which is a treat for the kids. If you need to get drinks, there's a small shop that sells beverages, which is great, especially during the winter season. I love this park as it's very spacious and has a lot to offer. Also summer time if you get lucky, there's a guy that plays music and collects donations for a few charities."
Bowness Park,Selin,5,"Went there with family, it was the best! Everyone enjoyed the peaceful bow river. Took a long walk and it was 100% worth it. BUT BRING SUNSCREEN AND BUG SPRAY! There are lots of mosquitoes in the season I went, so be prepared! Raft rental available! We went up a ramp and followed a trail. MUST GO ON THAT WALK! there are stairs too if you prefer. A little park with flowers and cute bear statue too! Brings back memories when I went as a  kid!!!"
Bowness Park,Rasgun,5,"Great place to walk around, go for a picnic and BBQ if living in Calgary!
There is a boathouse as well at a very reasonable price!
You can book your picnic sites by calling 311.
During the fall season the views are splendid, you can do fall photography at the best here.
There is a cute tiny rail for the toy train as well.
Benches, picnic tables are available all around the park.
You can also bring your own portable stove and cook at any available picnic table.
If you are booking picnic sites then you have your own shed and fire pit to enjoy"
Bowness Park,Dhruv Patel,5,The view there was really mesmerizing and one of the best place to witness sunset near Riverside and also a great place. Can calm your mind and also has a damn scenery in fall.
Eau Claire Park,Rasgun,5,"Great place to bike or just walk around and enjoy the natural scenic beauty.

You can drive e bikes along the bike path.
I have also seen northern lights twice here:)"

There are lots of sitting and resting areas. Nice views of the river!"
Eau Claire Park,Tomson Chan,5,"The water front path way and park areas cover both side of the river.  This is a very nice area for people to relax, stroll along the river (either sides), accessible by stroller, wheelchair as well with big open spaces and wide paved  pathways.

Excellent for a time for some outdoor activities. You can walk, jog, run, bike, scooter back and forth along the river.  Nice views of the river and river banks.

You can also find some nearby cafe, food places for snacks and coffee/tea to enjoy.

There are lots of sitting and resting areas as well to just chill and absorb the sunshine or to feel the cool breeze.

Excellent for people of all ages.  Highly recommended to spend some time here to be away from the busyness of life.  Enjoy your lunch or coffee time along the pathways. Or Just to enjoy the fresh air and outdoors.

You may see some Canada geese in the area as well.
Highly recommended!"
Eau Claire Park,Karina Santos,5,"Lovely place for relax, take pictures and admire the river!"

Griffith Woods Park,Emmy,4,"Parking wasn't too bad today. Bathrooms are right at trail head, and as far as we saw those are the only ones. You can go off the paved path to lots of other trails,  which is great if you want to go longer. Saw quite a few people, but it was Labor  Day, so I'm not surprised.  Originally, we saw lots of spots for the dog  to  go into the water. However,  at the trail head, a sign said there was whirling disease and went longer felt comfortable letting our dog in the water. Although we did see several people in the water at different points. Maybe safe? Didn't want to test it, though. Area feels like you are deep in a forest,  which is surprising as it's in a residential area. There were several fallen trees that we had to get over on the path we chose. Note- it was about 4 km, not 41. But it won't let me edit it."
Griffith Woods Park,Vids Tube,5,"Very good park with paved trail for running, biking and the whole trail is beside the Elbow river with crystal clear water. The whole trail is stroller and wheel chair accessible, however at the bridge shown in the attached video road was not paved well and was bumpy.
Ample parking spots with accessible one. The trail has little bifurcation to see the Elbow river and the water is very clear. In summer there can be bugs and mosquitoes. The trail had many benches to rest. The trail is very easy about 5.7km kids friendly however we did not find any parks but the entire trail was lush green with lots of flowers. On one end there is Discovery Ridge Pond where you will encounter wild life like ducks, beavers etc over all its fun and highly recommended. Check out videos & images amd follow for more detailed reviews."
Griffith Woods Park,Artemii Plekhanov,5,"It is one of the best parts of Calgary.  There are a lot of trails for cycling and hiking. We found 2 giant beaver's 🦫 dum, and  it was cool. There is a lot of room for playing with dogs. Some of the paths were closed because of the new rules. I should be the best place in Calgary for wildlife observation. Hundreds of birds were around us, and it was beautiful. Really recommend!"
Griffith Woods Park,Thuy Tran,5,Beautiful park with nice trails. Parking and washroom are available at starting point. Lots of shades from the trees making it really pleasant for a walk (and any activities). The outer loop trail is about 6km. Please please please bring your kids here and pack rubber boots. There are shallow water bodies and I saw kids really enjoying them.
Shouldice Park,Michael Richmond (Mortgage Broker),5,"Great turf, open views, good lighting.   Easy access to location.  The teams like to play here."
Shouldice Park,sanket patel,4,"It is a nice place for kids and adults. I took my family in July. I feel that it has good options for kids, but not that awesome place. I would rather be in edworthy park. If you are a bow river fan than it has nice spots to sit and enjoy the river. I loved that it has tennis courts open to public and really well maintained"
Shouldice Park,Johnnalyn Magsipoc,5,"Shouldice park is big park. To many thing to do there once you in, u can boating , biking,basketball,many picnic tables and also beautiful play ground for the kids. the place clean. Peoples can bike or walk the old bridge made by the wood. It’s amazing. Kids can play the side of lake."
Shouldice Park,Lily Riwukore,5,"Probably the best and the safest playground I've ever seen in Alberta. My kids love this playground; they can spend up to 3 hours nonstop playing until we ask them to stop. The design, the colour, the variety, and some educational parts, such as the Braille alphabet, are unique. Highly recommended!!"
Shouldice Park,Guilherme Teixeira,5,"Gorgeous park! Great playground for the kids, lot's of walking paths with tones of trees, shade and easy access to the river!"
Douglas Fir Trail Lookout Platform,Princess,5,"My first time going on a trail (not a fan of walking and being tired 😅) and I would say this is such a beautiful trail with lots of beautiful views. This trail made me want to hangout with nature more!

➡️ Would recommend to bring water. EXTRA EXTRA (or maybe I'm just always thirsty)
➡️ Have running shoes for sure
➡️ Have lots of stairs"
Douglas Fir Trail Lookout Platform,Mustafa Ibrahim,5,This trail is inside the city but feels like you're not. This is from the west entrance from Edworthy park. I walked east then returned to Edworthy park walking along the river (Bow river pathway) It's reasonable and most people can do it. Bicycles are not allowed on the trail; maybe because there are many stairs up and down.
Douglas Fir Trail Lookout Platform,Rose H,5,"Walked the trail to the lookout.  Beautiful spot.  A little steep and lots of stairs so it’s a pretty good workout.  We started at the West entrance and walked the whole trail to the East end and took the walking/bike trail back to the parking lot.  Very busy spot, go early."
Douglas Fir Trail Lookout Platform,Rachel Wiebe,5,"Felt like I was in BC while going through the steep trails! It was fun and I loved the stairs, the creek, and the overgrown feeling of the forest surrounding us."
Douglas Fir Trail Lookout Platform,Alex Sutherland,5,"A great inside the city nature spot. This walk/hike would be awesome for tourists from out of town or family’s from calgary that just wanna touch of nature with out having to leave the city, the path is mostly laid out trail and is clearly market. There is a steady incline so it could be a challenge for those who are mobility challenged but over a great place to spend an afternoon"
Fish Creek Provincial Park,John Spenceley,5,"Fish Creek Provincial Park is one of the largest urban parks in Canada, located in the southern part of Calgary. It spans over 13.5 square kilometers (5.2 square miles) and offers a mix of forested areas, open grasslands, and the winding Fish Creek, which flows into the Bow River."
Fish Creek Provincial Park,Keith Stahl,5,"Fish Creek Park truly has something for everyone. From swimming in the lake the hiking to walking, rollerblading to single track mountain biking. Bring the fam for a picnic and enjoy time at the creek on a warm night while the sun goes down. The facilities are modern and convenient, and access points are plentiful. The is a year round park and some lots close at night. Camping is not permitted. This is a provincial park within the city of Calgary. Lots of wildlife so enjoy and keep your best friends on their leash. Some pliéing in the winter months for bike commuters. A vast park with a bit of everything."
Fish Creek Provincial Park,TRVL_888,5,"Fish Creek Provincial Park is one of the largest urban parks in Canada, located in Calgary, Alberta. Spanning over 13.5 square miles (35 square kilometers), the park offers a mix of natural areas, picnic spots, and pathways for walking, biking, and birdwatching. The park follows the course of Fish Creek, which flows through the Bow River, and is known for its lush ecosystems, including forests, wetlands, and meadows. Wildlife such as deer, beavers, and a variety of bird species can be seen in the park.

Fish Creek Provincial Park is also home to historical landmarks, including the Bow Valley Ranch, as well as visitor facilities such as the Sikome Aquatic Facility, which is a man-made lake open for swimming during the summer. The park’s extensive trail system makes it a popular destination for outdoor activities, nature enthusiasts, and families.

.:.Chat.G.P.T.:."
Fish Creek Provincial Park,Artemii Plekhanov,4,"We walked through the eastern half of the park, and it took a couple of hours. This part of the park consists of prairie landscape and some bushes near the Fish Creek river.  It was a little bit monotonous, but we found a few interesting places. It'd be better if you came here with bicycles. I really want to explore more wild west parts of the park."
Fish Creek Provincial Park,Dondon Herrera,5,"I found the variety of landscapes refreshing. There are quiet spots by the river perfect for reflection or even a picnic, and more open areas where you can feel the breeze and soak in the sun. Wildlife is abundant here, making it easy to spot birds, deer, and even the occasional beaver.

For me, Fish Creek is more than just a park—it’s a place to relax, reset, and appreciate nature. If you’re in Calgary and looking for an outdoor adventure that doesn’t take you far from the city, this park is a must-visit!"
Lawrey Gardens Park,No longer using,5,"I cannot say enough about the wonderful biking and running/walking trails at this park.  They go forever and people are very respectful about cycling.  The river is gorgeous and the trail is so different end to end.  I take my dog here nearly every day.   We do our ""big walk"" here both Saturday and Sunday morning.  From the parking lot to one of the bridges and back is about 10k.   Good parking and a beautifully kept picnic area with washrooms."
Lawrey Gardens Park,Bharat Shah,5,"These gardens along the Bow River Pathway, with Bow River on south and busy Bowness street on the north, provide incredibly picturesque views of the captivating and tranquil nature.

The waterfront park has lots of benches all along the walking trail and close to the the beach area. Moreover, there are plenty of trees all along the paved trails.

Visitors may enjoy the scenes of a number of electrified people
sailing on the water in their different kinds of boats, or walking, running, cycling, and skating on the pathways.

visitors and their small children may amuse themselves with all the activities around them without fear of being hit by a bicycle rider or a skateboarder, for there are dedicated trails for walkers/runners and cyclists/skaters.

If you walk west, you arrive at the popular Edworthy Park. There is a humongous parking lot where you may park your car, for free. Also, you may park your vehicles on the side streets.

There are clean, well-maintained washrooms in the Edworthy Park. Also there is a restaurant, Angel's Cafe, if you want to have a cup of coffee or eat something.

This is a must visit sightseeing place in Calgary."
Lawrey Gardens Park,Sherry C.,5,Lake view. Beautiful place. Choosing another road and missing the platform this time.
Lawrey Gardens Park,James Mott,5,"A very pretty pathway area along the river for walking, and solitude. Some bikes move fast on the bike portion."
Lawrey Gardens Park,Yoru Raven,5,It's such a nice place for walking or cycling
Crescent Heights Park,Huong Dang,5,"Calgary, I wasn’t aware of your game! After a very satisfying late lunch / early dinner at Homey Cafe, I came here for my hot girl digestive walk. Little did I know that I was stumbling into the crown jewel of Calgary. You can see the downtown skyline view very clearly from this park. If I wasn’t exhausted from my road trip and had to prep for an early flight the next day, I would have loved to spend a couple more hours here until the sun set. I loved seeing the separated protected bike lane next to the wide sidewalks. I loved that I could walk from here to Prince’s Island and through into downtown. I also walked the surrounding residential neighborhood and encountered a neat heritage tree that was teeming with fruits. From the outside, I could see that the residents and visitors alike were so happy to be able to enjoy this park. I saw people taking iconic photos with the skyline. I saw friends sitting on the bench and chit chatting with the skyline in their sight. I spent a wonderful early evening at this park, and I’ll definitely be back the next time I’m in Calgary."
Crescent Heights Park,Dariush Malekirad,5,"Awesome park, it has playground, tennis courts,  baseball field,  lots of picknick table and breathtaking Calgary downtown view. Only issue there is that there is no parking and street parking is limited to permit holders or limited areas with maximum 2 hours only for daytime."
Crescent Heights Park,Steve Gordon,5,"This is a great social spot, yes there can be numerous issues but it’s usually managed by parking authority and police doing drive by’s, overall I can see how the residents would be upset...give it some time and everything will subside and the hooligans will find a new place to hang out. It’s clean and there’s rarely any garbage. A lot of families interact well with everyone that’s there. This place has great stairs if you want to train as well"
Crescent Heights Park,Summer,5,"There are many places in Calgary with great views for sightseeing and nice spots for a stroll, but I especially like this place."
Crescent Heights Park,Zen D.,5,"Clean and Pristine! Very nice for taking a walk. You can see beautiful houses, lush greenery, and the most beautiful view of the city! Check it out!"
South Glenmore Park,Terry Ugonabo,5,"The beautiful scenery is peaceful, and you get to breathe in the fresh air. I walked around the lake and ended up taking over 20,000 steps without even realizing it. It's a fantastic place for social gatherings and for nature lovers."
South Glenmore Park,Ly C.,5,"Not as many trees as the North Glenmore Park. Quite abeautiful riverside walking trail & cycling lane, once you pass the Private Boat Parking area. Follow it and you will reach Heritage Park."
South Glenmore Park,Caitlyn Cairns,5,"I like to walk the entire loop, and if you arrive early in the morning it’s super quiet, not busy and the wildlife is very active. Everyone you do end up passing is always super friendly!"
South Glenmore Park,Marnie Campbell,4,"South Glenmore Park is an absolute gem in Calgary!  I love the scenic walking trails that offer stunning views of the reservoir. The park features a well-maintained bike path that stretches over 16 kilometers, perfect for cycling enthusiasts. The highlight for families is the fantastic water park, which provides endless fun for kids on hot summer days. The only downside is that in the summer  the parking lot can get quite full."
South Glenmore Park,Michael Phillips,5,"My favourite place to chill on my day off, whether I just want to sit by the water or trek along the path around the perimeter of the reservoir.
I have had the opportunity to kayak from here and I recommend it, well done and beautiful 🙏"
Elliston Park,Victoria Di,5,"This is my absolute favorite spot to start the day. The breathtaking views of the lake are nothing short of magical—each glance feels like a painting brought to life. It’s not just a place; it’s an experience.

The serene atmosphere makes it the perfect retreat for clear thinking and peaceful walks. Every step here feels like a connection to nature, a gentle pause in the rush of life.

If you’re looking for a hidden gem where beauty meets tranquility, this is it. Truly a place that feeds the soul and sparks inspiration."
Elliston Park,Jazmin Higgins,5,"This is one of our favourite parks, there’s a loop around the water with half of it being an off leash dog area, and there’s an amazing playground. Playground is great for all ages, with a swing, merry go round, seated zip line, slides and the rubber on the ground. The washrooms aren’t anything special as they’re just portable toilets but at least they have some. Lots of picnic bench’s."
Elliston Park,Betty Gervais,3,"Could use better washrooms. The ones along the hwy to Banff are better than here.  Otherwise, it's a nice big park. Several different paths, so there's lots of room for everyone. A big playground for the kids. Parking on east and west sides of park."
Elliston Park,Franzel Sagarino,5,"Very relaxing place. It has trail for walking and biking, playground for kids and a very beautiful lake. Great for family picnic!"
Elliston Park,Thea Graham,1,"After 20 years of enjoying walking my dogs at this park, I am sad to say it is no longer a good experience.  The city allows tenters in the park who, as they move around the park, leave refuse behind that spoils the natural areas and creates safety hazards for people and their dogs.
One of these ""campers"", set up on the path in the off-leash area, told me to take my dog and get out of the park.

Fox glove, very dangerous for dogs proliferates along thei off-leash pathways and more garbage surrounds the lake, left there when the water recedes after a rain.

There is not adequate dog park signage along the road indicating on and off-leash areas so people entering the dog park are unaware that they have,  This causes problems between dog owners and joggers/bikers and others who are not comfortable around dogs.  I have witessed several altercations."
Tom Campbell's Hill Natural Park,Brian Coville,3,"It's just a small neighborhood park, nothing special. People use it for an off-leash dog park or drink coffee enijoying beautiful city views.The park isn't very accessible by transit. As you get close to downtown, you're required to have a parking permit for your car. The park does have limited parking that doesn't require a permit.
360 photo for 2015 March 24."
Tom Campbell's Hill Natural Park,Vitória Lundgren,5,"Go for a run with your dog off leash or just a walk in the park by yourself, it is pretty cool!
I really like how it is a tall hill you can see all city but it’s so flat on top."
Tom Campbell's Hill Natural Park,Lisa Chan,5,"Large off leash dog park with beautiful city views.  You can see Deerfoot Trail, Memorial Drive and downtown skyline.  Nice and open with paved and unpacked pathways and benches for you to rest and take in the views.  This park is walkable to Bridgeland, Calgary Zoo, Telus Science Centre and downtown Calgary.  Great in any season with lots of friendly people and their dogs.  Small free parking lot."
Tom Campbell's Hill Natural Park,Sasha Butts,5,"I love this park. Always friendly dogs! My girls just love it, great view. Great little walk. Close to lots of stuff and central!"
Tom Campbell's Hill Natural Park,Pradeep Nomula,5,"Nice place for dog walk, casual walk, book reading and watching Calgary skyline.. visited first time and going to visit again and again in summer."
Bowmont Park,Joe Braun,5,"Quick, quiet 20-minute loop around a pond.  You can leave the path across the bike path and venture into hills with pathways.  Great for active dogs."
Bowmont Park,Sandra Anderson,5,"Looking for hilly walk with stunning views? Check out Bowmont Natural Environment Park. This dog-friendly park can give you a gentle to moderate workout should you stay on the paved pathways and plenty of benches to enjoy the view.
Feeling a little more adventurous? Walk along one of the natural paths but be prepared for switchbacks and rocky terrain, plus keep a lookout for mountain bikers.
Will be back again soon."
Bowmont Park,Sean Leeson,5,"My dog and I regularly visit Bowmont Park throughout the year as there are many trails to explore and various elevations that can suit various physical abilities.

You can stay on the regular paved path, just be careful of ice during the winter months, or explore some of the trails cut through the park.

The majority of the paths are shared with cyclists, so if you have your dog off-leash, just be prepared to move aside for the bikes."
Bowmont Park,xo,5,Beautiful place to walk and explore the nature!! Great place to walk your dog (off-leash park) but make sure you bring water and keep your fur baby on leash if need! :P Very peaceful and calm❤️
Bowmont Park,Alhan Yaz,5,"Beautiful place! You have the view of the river, there are benches, pathways, and a good amount of parking space. Great spot for dog walking. Definitely a place to visit to take in the beauty of the city."
St. Patrick's Island Park,Russell Reed,5,"St Patrick's island is a quiet little area offering a nice blend of nature and urbanity. I walked around here several times while I was staying a short distance north in Bridgeland.

There's some winding pathways, play area, a beach area, and some stunning views of the downtown skyline. Nice little escape just on the edge of the city."
St. Patrick's Island Park,Tommy Chan,5,"Perfect park for landscape photos. Better take in the morning because of the sun direction. We saw a couple taking wedding photos here. The front view can be trail with plants. More far away comes the river and the land on the opposite side. The most far away in the photo is buildings.

There’s a campfire spot available for everyone (first come first served) on a small cute hill. You may also play sledge during winter when there is snow of the slope."
St. Patrick's Island Park,Courtney Tario,5,"This used to be a really sketchy place to go. I know the city had rejuvenated it quite a long time ago, but it's been my first trip here in over a decade, and what a lovely surprise.

The space is huge, perfect for events, live music, and a rafting stop.

The playground, signage, and history are all really great. The Toboggan Hill is neat, I'd love to see it in the winter.

The beach is beautiful and surprisingly quiet considering how central it is. Overall, I've had a great experience, I'm kinda sad I've missed so much time that I could have been enjoying this space."
St. Patrick's Island Park,Millie M.,5,"Really nice and pretty park to stroll through. They have delicate flowers along the trails, so be careful not to step onto them. They also have a playground if you want to bring your kids along."
St. Patrick's Island Park,Jonique Life,5,"We went here while it was Canada Day and it was such a fun place to explore. We walked around the whole park which was approx. 2km, it’s very flat and all paved. There are many places to chill with a picnic and enjoy the nice environment. Parking is quite expensive here, we just parked a bit further away on a side street with free parking.

“Jonique Life”  If you find value in our reviews please consider following our social media outlets on Facebook and Instagram as we highlight magical places you can add to your ever growing bucket list."
Tomkins Park,Ehab Kardouh,5,"It's a great place next to many stores. Actually, you can always hear car's noise and music from other placee, so It's not the best place to visit when you are looking for a calm place.

I think this is the perfect spot when you want to sit for a while after shopping from nearby stores or when you want to eat your lunch after buying it from a nearby restaurant."
Tomkins Park,Rachel Wiebe,5,"This is my favorite hotspot on 17th Ave! During the summer, there is Saturday's on 17th which hosts live music, free face painting, bouncy houses, outdoor games, and more. Now they had there first ever farmer's market and it was a hit with free caricatures and henna! The tree's are beautiful and large, like being under a canopy. Always a pleasure stopping here to eat on a bench or pet a local dog out for a walk."
Tomkins Park,chris kupidy,4,"Nice small  inner city park - some good buskers there sometimes and movies and other events.
There is  inner city stuff like homeless and impaired people but it's pretty safe.
No washrooms and dog friendly but on leash only ."
Tomkins Park,Darren DeLorme,4,"A nice little park along 17th Ave in lower Mount Royal, close to Beltline. Several places to get lunch or a coffee nearby. However if someone is looking for a quiet park, this would be far from that, due to the fact it's on 17th Avenue. The park is approximately two city blocks long, and one city block wide, with plenty of large trees offering shade, benches, tables and chairs.

It's great that Calgary has so many little parks like this scattered throughout downtown, Beltline, Connaught, and Lower Mount Royal.

Tompkins Park even has a stage to host bands and entertainment. A couple of weeks ago I saw a solo entertainer singing and playing guitar who was very good. Periodically the BRZ has ""movie night"" where they have a large screen TV and sound system set up. Last week was 80s night, and they played several well-known movies from the 1980s.

There is however the street element, so those from the burbs might not be prepared, or willing to tolerate that.

Back in June there was some guy whacked out of his mind screaming and waving a syringe full of blood around at people as they walked by in Tompkins Park. Someone called the cops, but by the time they got there the guy was long gone. This isn't something that happens often, but just be prepared and be aware of your surroundings. Another guy climbed one of the tall pine trees in the park, and was shouting humorous obscenities to unsuspecting passersby below. That was actually rather amusing.

All that being said, I'm still giving Tompkins Park a four-star rating. I've been coming to the park since the 1980s."
Tomkins Park,Ilya D.,5,Sweet and cozy place.
Reader Rock Garden,Anastasia Kircheva,5,What a stunning little location! Ideal for small to mid sized weddings and quiet! The locations offers amazing variety of spots to photograph formals and ceremony.
Reader Rock Garden,Noela Batinić,5,"Beautiful to walk through on an early autumn afternoon. Lots of little pathways with stepping stones amongst the trees that feels like a secret garden.

A favourite and quiet spot just south of busy downtown. You can access it from Union Cemetery, and Union Cemetery is accessible from it."
Reader Rock Garden,Monisha soans,5,Beautiful serene place nested in the heart of the city. Rocky stones well maintained tracks brings so much joy to walk around. unique Flowers and plants adds to the beautiful park. This park also has lovely views of the downtown calgary skyline
Reader Rock Garden,Laura Maria Castro Gonzalez,5,Nice little garden. Some flowers look dry probably have suffered from the recent water restrictions in Calgary. The parking lot is small. I liked the benches around the park where you can seat around the flowers. I would totally visit again!
Reader Rock Garden,Michael Gray,5,"Easily one of the most stunning and peaceful spots to visit in inner city Calgary in the summer time. An absolute must for plant and flower lovers. The space is very scenic and historic, next to a very beautiful and also historic Calgary cemetery. Also convenient being next to the stampede grounds."
Bottomlands Park,Pamela DeBrocke,5,"Best visit to the Calgary Zoo yet! There were more animals to see at the zoo this sunny Sunday afternoon than during the middle of the summer. Lots of animals were out and were close to the fences to enjoy. We got to see all the animals  in the Canadian area, including an eagle and snow owl. We got see a one week old baby zebra. It wasn't too busy today either, so you didn't have to wait for food in the cafeteria. There was a bit of a wait for our lattes attend Starbucks since only one person was working at the time."
Bottomlands Park,Tyler Uiselt,4,"Great park to start ab dog walk! Get all the sniffs in and washroom duties, before the high social stimulation of meeting all sorts of other dogs! (Which is great!) The the view of the city is beautiful once you merge into Tom Campbell's hill!"
Bottomlands Park,Caleb Fisaha,4,2 large football (soccer) pitches that can be booked on the CoC website. No flood lights though
Bottomlands Park,Sean Hogan,5,Great scenery and places to stop for a while.
Bottomlands Park,Dallas Barnes,5,Save your money and ditch the zoo. Take the walk around it. You see animals. Great place to take your dog!
Thomson Family Park,Jordan,5,"Nice little park with a skating rink in the winter time. It’s well lit during the night and is usually not too busy in the evening as well, great for pandemic social distancing. Haha! This park also has a nice giant slide and a small playground for the kids to play at. The design and lighting on this place is very modern and there are some picnic benches and normal benches on the side to sit down and chill out. Parking isn’t too bad, street parking can be tricky during the weekday as you still have to pay during those times but it’s usually free parking in the evening and weekend. It’s nice and close to 17th Ave which has good access to some great pubs and restaurants."
Thomson Family Park,Rachel Wiebe,5,"Great, clean, and fun outdoor playground! The bubblers are a hit and the large rope structure is fun for adults too as it gets quite high. The huge slide is a top a man made hill which has a nice view that kids love experiencing. Good for ages 2 and up!"
Thomson Family Park,Nigel Lalande,4,"It's a great park for kids of all ages.

The only reason I'm rating this a 4 is because there is no fence to protect the kids from the adjacent street. It doesn't make sense to me.

Pros
Has a cool slide
Unique play features
The old lights from the former lawn bowling club are a nice touch

Cons
No fence"
Thomson Family Park,narendra katuri,5,Great place all the time. Water fountain was awesome in summers.. very good park for kids.. slider is always awesome
Thomson Family Park,Ainsley Mazak,5,"I love going here! Lots of thing to do, this is one of my favorite parks and it is close to many things. I would recommend Thomson family park !"
Sien Lok Park,Divya D.A.K,5,"Beautiful commemoration of history. 3 small sculptures but with powerful backstory. An easy way to understand the contribution of the Chinese immigrants in Canada
Plus a beautiful water front walkway and ample place to sit and rest"
Sien Lok Park,He Daqing,5,A small well maintained park with many artifacts of the history of early Chinese immigrants. Enjoyed reading those texts and stories. Feel connected with those early immigrants.
Sien Lok Park,Tommy Chan,4,"It’s a great park with chinese history in calgary clearly explained in the sign. There’re also a nice river view. You may see bridges along the coast as well.

There’re quite a lot of wide animals such as geese and birds. It’s good to enjoy sunshine while walking/ biking in the park. There is a large grass area for you to rest on as well."
Sien Lok Park,SS,5,"Very nice park with the touch to Chinese history.  It is better to come here through the Chinese district so that you can dive into the atmosphere from the beginning.
Interesting installation, some benches to sit & relax.
From this place you can continue to another park which is just beside."
Sien Lok Park,Ehab Kardouh,5,"This is a great park, but there is one of the art sculptures that needs to be fixed as it misses few parts of ut and I showed that with pictures I took using my phone."
Sandy Beach Park,Ilya D.,5,"Great park. There are several locations where you can cook bbq, big location for kids and pet friendly area. Toilet is present."
Sandy Beach Park,Randy,3,Beautiful park but currently under construction
Sandy Beach Park,Bette P,4,"This is a wonderful place to bring the family for a walk or ride a bike. Beautiful riverside location. It has many picnic sites, bbq stand, fire pits, playgrounds, pathways, seasonal washrooms and water fountain. There are plenty of green space and tall trees. It has off-leash area for dogs to enjoy too. Only four stars because we didn’t expect that the new play ground will get crowded on a Monday morning."
Sandy Beach Park,Kevin Lee,5,"Lovely place for family. Especially with kids. Parking is a little bit hard if you come in the middle of the day. We went there around 11 am, and only 1 spot was available."
Sandy Beach Park,Mann,5,"I really like this place ❤️ This is a wonderful place to bring the family for a walk or ride a bike. Beautiful riverside location. It has many picnic sites, bbq stand, fire pits, playgrounds, pathways, seasonal washrooms and water fountain. There are plenty of green space and tall trees. It has off-leash area for dogs to enjoy too."
Haultain Park,Ehab Kardouh,5,"It's an amazing park for family and everyone.  There is a place for each person regardless of their ages.

There is a big playground for playing soccer, jogging or playing around. In addition to that, there is a tennis playground, so you can enjoy having a game with your friends there, but of course you should bring your tennis ball and bats with you.

There are games for kids as well, so they will enjoy playing together there.

Everyone can have fun here, so I recommend this park to individuals, families and groups."
Haultain Park,Sean Walters,5,Great little park. With a nice little green space. Tennis courts. The area seems to be dog friendly and quite busy with the residential buildings that are to the east of the green space. Two playgrounds were nice for little kids with some swing options as well. Parking was a little hard but not impossible a short walk might be accompanied with parking at this location.
Haultain Park,Hiu Yan Chan,5,The park is great for my 16 months old. It has many different parts that for older kids than it for younger (under 3). There are a basket swing for younger kids and open swing and a dis swing. Some of the slide is very steep.
Haultain Park,Shravani PL,5,This park is beautiful and that too it is in the centre of the city. It’s also well maintained. You can get good view of Calgary tower from here.
Haultain Park,Kay C,4,"This is a great little park that is often not very busy. It does not have very much shade. Half of the park is currently under construction as they build the new tower and parkade on the other side. Lots of things to climb and play on for toddlers, preschoolers and school aged kids."
New Edinborough Park,Hector FM,4,A nice park during the summer time. It transforms into a nice and convenient ice rink during the winter. Very nicely kept and a good place to practice if you are learning how to skate and are looking for a place to exercise your skills or just want to play a friendly hockey game.
New Edinborough Park,Michael Patino,5,"During winter it has a ice rink, playground and fire pit with chairs and picnic table.

During summer it has the same as above except instead of an ice rink it has a large green space to play games or suntan or just chill!"
New Edinborough Park,Lora Mathurin,1,"This place doesn't have much for younger kids. My 2 year old is terrified to go up the little stairs which are very steep by the way. So I helped him climb up the other side and when he got up there, it was so high for him that he was scared to move. I climbed up myself and realized that this is not a place for little kids, it's very dangerous. For those who want to be independent and play on their own, they can't even land off the slide safely because it's too high off the ground."
New Edinborough Park,A Pie,5,Cute and beautiful with an amazing playground
New Edinborough Park,Jack Mills,5,"A ridiculously beautiful park. In the summer the beauty levels might literally blind you. I don't know what it is, but it's just mesmerizing. Perfect stop after a walk around Sunnyside/Rosedale."
Laycock Park,Brian Derksen,4,We went tobogganing there. Decent sized hill. Steep enough to get some speed going down the hill and not too steep as to get tired after coming up the hill more than once. Would suggest going after a fresh wet snowfall for better snow if you'd like to build a small jump. Don't wait for the snow to dry out.
Laycock Park,Val Cao,5,"At the time of our visit (April 2021) it was very clean and spacious in a sense where there weren’t a lot of people (covid times is a factor I’m sure) but thoroughly enjoyed the double swing with an infant. Our son loved it and it fitted him perfect (11 months) he also loves going down the big slides supervised and supported of course. The parking lot (end of an industrial street) for the playground was slightly of a distance though but on a nice day was an enjoyable walk. There’s also a basketball court by the parking lot. There’s also picnic area that is covered by a roof, great for shade. There’s also a dog park area somewhere cause we kept seeing little four legged friends around."
Laycock Park,Shannon Delahunt,5,"The park name makes me giggle but all jokes aside this is one of my most favourite spots in all of Calgary! The number of life changing moments I've had here are really profound. I go there to shake off my day and connect with nature in what ways I can. The lil bit or trees in the lower areas make for a sweet lil forest bush place to walk dogs. The play structures are pretty new and fun for lil ones (covid willing!) Theres even a shaded spot for picnics.

All in all, it's small but mighty and a nice time for all ages"
Laycock Park,Mark Mcleod,3,Parks been under going renos fir the last 20 years it seems       playground is pretty decent fir the kids     but some people who are housing or dwelling  challenged  have staked a claim in the bushes right there  and it smells like pee there    not normal pee either   like a dehydrated dirty ol trucker pee      so thick it's almost a sauce        blegh     yuck
Laycock Park,Myron “MyGuy” Guy,5,Clean and quiet tranquil place in the middle of the city
Munro Park,Ehab Kardouh,5,"This is an amazing huge park in the north of calgary. It consists of a big playground which is prepared for soccer games, so you will need only a football to play a match here.

There is a good spot for kids and it was provided with beautiful games for them. There are many seats around the place, but they are distributed everywhere.

There are specific games for muscles strength and they were placed on specific spots. I didn't try them because I didn't know how to use them, but I took pictures for those games.

There are few tables around the place as well, so you can enjoy a meal with your family and friends.

Finally, it's an interesting park to visit and spend time with family and friends."
Munro Park,S P,5,"It's nice coming here seeing the kids play soccer or other teams, its always a nice place to sit with no garbage around or drugs addicts, but once in awhile drug addicts do hang in the park."
Munro Park,Barrett Wilson,5,"It’s actually a great local space for the community. I usually come here with my dog everyday and we are people exercising, running, playing or relaxing at all times. There’s outdoor work out equipment and a big loop for runners. It’s easy to miss but will become your go-to outdoor space in Tuxedo."
Munro Park,Sam R,4,"It's a great little park.

It's kinda unnerving to see so many homeless people shooting up in the summer while there are kids playing.

Also I wish they would have a dog friendly area"
Munro Park,Tracy Oetelaar,5,"This park was re-done just prior to the pandemic.

There is a tot park for kids,  an excellent oval shaped, paved asphalt walking / rollerblading path, with a few ""workout stations"" along the route.  It is a popular place for people to play soccer and a great place to walk the dog, throw the frisbee, or go for a jog.

There are a few benches to sit and people watch, rest, or to get some sunshine.

Close to Capri Pizza, 7-11,  and an Esso"
Sue Higgins Park,Bharat Shah,4,"There are over 160 off-leash dog areas in multi used parks for Calgarians and their dogs to play and enjoy. Among all those, Sue Higgins Park, that lies in 62-hectare natural area at the banks of Bow River in Calgary South East, is the largest.
In this fenced park, there are a couple of main areas and a number of smaller fenced areas for hundreds of dogs and their human companions.
There is a 4 km loop trail that runs along the Bow River; nonetheless, it is at a significant distance from the river and is barricaded, so it does not provide any exciting and pleasing views and enjoyment to those who want to enjoy a river front-walk. There are a few benches, but my wife and I did not see anyone walking on the trail or sitting on the benches.
You may go to the other side of the river by crossing the Eric Harvey Bridge that is not far from the entrance. On this side, there are a couple of picnic tables, and the best thing is that you may go to the river and do all sorts of water activities. Walk along the river and in just 400 meters, there is a beautiful lakefront park named Carburn Park which is for families and people with children.
Although Sue Higgins Park is a good natural area with plenty of trees, bushes, marshy areas, grasslands, a paved trail along the river bank, it is created for dogs and dog owners; you may see lots of dogs at one place.
If you do not have a dog, it is a good idea to visit it once just to see the city’s largest dog park, but I do not recommend it for outings for fun and picnics with or without families. If you are scared of dogs, please do not visit this park, for you may encounter unleashed, aggressive dogs at several places."
Sue Higgins Park,Mahmoud kh,5,"""Step into a paradise tailored for our four-legged companions and their devoted owners! This dog park is a testament to the joy and camaraderie shared between dogs and humans alike. As you enter, a sense of excitement fills the air as pups of all breeds and sizes romp freely across lush green fields, their tails wagging with boundless enthusiasm.

The attention to detail is evident in every corner, from the meticulously maintained grounds to the thoughtfully placed amenities. Water stations strategically dot the landscape, providing refreshment for both canines and their caregivers. Shaded seating areas offer respite from the sun, allowing for moments of relaxation and socialization amidst the lively atmosphere.

But it's not just the physical space that makes this park exceptional—it's the sense of community that thrives within its boundaries. Here, friendships are forged, both furry and otherwise, as dog owners come together to share stories, tips, and laughter. Whether it's a game of fetch, a leisurely stroll along the designated paths, or simply basking in the joy of watching our canine companions revel in their freedom, every moment spent here is infused with warmth and camaraderie.

And let's not forget the thoughtful segregation of play areas, ensuring that dogs of all sizes can enjoy their time without worry. From the pint-sized pups to the gentle giants, each one finds their place to frolic and explore in safety and comfort.

In conclusion, this dog park isn't just a place—it's an experience. It's a celebration of the bond between humans and dogs, a sanctuary where tails wag, hearts swell, and memories are made. Whether you're a seasoned dog owner or simply looking to bask in the joy of canine companionship, this park promises an unforgettable adventure for all who enter its gates."""
Sue Higgins Park,Stacey O'Sullivan,5,"This is such an amazing Dog Park, we’re so lucky to have it. It’s super easily accessible with lots of different terrains based on what your dog enjoys. In the summer, there’s lots of river access and for dogs like mine that love flushing there’s lots of groups of bushes and trees she can run through."
Sue Higgins Park,will booth,5,I love Sue Higgins Park. I prefer the part by the river - but all of it's good. Very big. Here was me my first time there: 🫨
Sue Higgins Park,L. Smith,5,"What a great place to just let your dog roam free and wild!
Secure gates ensure your pet is always safe and secure within the confines of the park.
I let my Lab Ruby run free here for the first time, she had a blast!
She always had a huge smile on her face and the other dogs were well behaved.
If it's summer time and it's hot outside, let your dog run in the river and cool off. 😎
A great place to stretch your legs as well! We will be going back for sure. 10☆ !"
Flyover Park,April Chan-Tsui,5,"Cool little playground under an overpass. The play structure along the steep hill was pretty unique, with a slide that's like a conveyor belt, a suspension-like bridge, and some other climbing structures and slides. There were also swings and a bamboo forest climbing structure.

Because the hill is quite steep, it is largely for older kids, and younger kids/toddlers will find it hard to play on without a lot of support.

Most of the play structures were not shaded (a few things are underneath the overpass, but not most, so when it's really sunny and hot, the play areas can get hot."
Flyover Park,Danelle Wright,5,"Really unique swings and slides in a unique location!  An interesting mix of urban landscape and bee-friendly gardens as well.  It is small but worth a visit and you can walk to St. Patrick’s Island bridge in about ten minutes.

My only wish would be for a picnic bench or seating under the overpass to get out of the sun.  And the glass stucco is coming undone and laying around, however it doesn’t seem particularly sharp."
Flyover Park,A Z,5,"Great new park! A couple of really nice long slides (roller style & regular), and some fun swing sets (one is a tandem seat swing!). Rubbery flooring to soften falls. Games including ping pong, tetherball, ladder ball, & bocce. Climbing poles that look like bamboo, ropes & nets to climb up.

Several seating areas for parents in various parts of the playground.

Smaller kids (under ~ 5 or 6) will be thrilled by the swings and slides, but there isn’t as much for them to climb up and down as for bigger kids (6+). Would be a good park to visit if you have multiple kids of various ages.

Also, walking distance to Lukes Drug Mart, Village, Una, Phil & Seb’s, and many other locally owned businesses if you need a tasty treat!"
Flyover Park,Jonathan Besler,4,"The park was well maintained and clean when we were there.
The kids enjoyed it.
I found the '70s stucco style concrete, with embedded pieces of glass, at the bicycle parking spot and as a border throughout the park, rather unusual and a little concerning."
Flyover Park,Melissa Malejko,5,"We *loved* this park! The roller slide was so fun, I went down it multiple times, until I was too tired to climb the hill again. Ping pong table which was in the shade was fun, too. What an amazing space!"
River Park,TRVL_888,5,Such a great panoramic view of Elbow river.
River Park,Dario Gonzalez,5,My favorite park in Calgary to walk my dogs
River Park,Cameron Hunter,5,"Best park! Our boy will have a memorial tree there soon!!
Great for dogs with decent recall and some short walk to river access for the dogs."
River Park,Ainsley Mazak,5,"I love going to this park! Has great views of the elbow river puls city, and just a nice place to relax and walk around with friends. Would recommend going here!"
River Park,Brooke Franchuk,5,"Great park, often busy but big enough you have your own space. Its quite icy right now but if you walk off the main path the snow is traction enough. The one side is not fenced next to the road so please drive slowly along there and leash your dog before you get near it to leave as well."
Murdoch Park,Radhika Jamwal,5,Most amazing park in summers! Lovely crabapple trees blooms and picnic tables to dine! Lush green grass
Murdoch Park,Serafina Montefresco-White (Olivia Prior),5,"I got my grad photos done here, it’s such a beautiful park. I’m so happy to see what they did with the land the old general hospital used to be on"
Murdoch Park,AJ Coutts,5,Beautiful park. Very open and clean (no garbage clutter anywhere). Well maintained grounds.
Murdoch Park,Jennifer Armstrong,5,"This is a great place to bring children of all ages.. It has many fun things to play on..such as rock climbing that promote educational mind building activities.  The playground is lined with soft padding in case of a trip or fallible call it "" The Safe Park"" because it's very safe. No dogs allowed in the playground itself but there is a huge field of Green Grass to the side. Lots of activities are played on the field.. As well as Yoga groups. The only downside is there is NO washrooms."
Murdoch Park,Surya K Narayanan,5,Wonderful place to hang out. Visited there to see spring in Calgary.
High Park,Serg D,4,"High Park: Calgary's Rooftop Urban Oasis

Perched atop a massive parking structure in downtown Calgary, High Park offers a unique urban experience. This innovative space may lack traditional greenery, but it more than makes up for it with its creative design and breathtaking views.

The park features basketball courts, perfect for a quick game while enjoying the city skyline. Scattered around are viewing areas where visitors can take in panoramic views of Calgary's bustling streets and impressive architecture. For those looking to celebrate special occasions, the park provides tables ideal for birthday parties or casual gatherings.

While High Park may not be your typical green space, its clever use of an otherwise unutilized area showcases Calgary's commitment to urban planning. The park's elevated position offers a fresh perspective on the city, making it a must-visit spot for both locals and tourists.

Despite its unconventional nature, High Park stands as a testament to Calgary's innovative spirit, providing a unique recreational space that rises above the urban landscape – both literally and figuratively."
High Park,Todd Rodgers,5,"High Park makes fantastic use of the top level of a parking garage! 🏀 With basketball courts and plenty for kids to do, it's a fun spot for families. We even caught a movie playing when we visited. 🎬"
High Park,Monny GM,4,"It's a great spot to take some nice photos with the tower and downtown as your backdrop! However, during the summer, it gets very hot, and there’s little to no shade, so it's best to avoid visiting during the hottest hours."
High Park,lisarose berreth-feragen,5,every time i come to high park i remember how relaxing and unique of a space it is. i have ate birthday cake at the picnic tables in march while it was a somewhat sunny day and i have done a yoga class on an extremely sunny day and i have also just hung out of the bench swings with my bestie to enjoy a few moments of peace. such a hidden (and it’s so easy to find) gem.
High Park,Elias Williams,5,I’ve seen pictures of high park for a while now and I finally got to stop by! It was beautiful to watch the sun begin to set up there. I went on a Sunday night. Parking was easy. If you’re looking for a cool place to enjoy some takeout or just play some outdoor games with friends this is a cool space. They have a turf area and 4 half court basketball courts. Excited to see what else they add into here!
Century Gardens,John Spenceley,5,"A hidden oasis in downtown Calgary, Century Gardens is a unique urban park inspired by Alberta’s rugged landscape. Originally designed in 1975, the park features dramatic concrete formations, cascading waterfalls, and lush greenery, creating a tranquil retreat amid the city’s high-rises. Recently revitalized, it now includes modern seating areas, open green spaces, and interactive water features while preserving its original Brutalist design elements. Whether for a peaceful escape, a scenic lunch break, or a place to admire public art, Century Gardens is a refreshing downtown gem."
Century Gardens,Darryl S,4,"I don’t normally go downtown but I thought I’d drop by as I knew they had renovated this park since last time I’ve been down here. I like the open and airy layout, fresh and lots of open space. On the negatives they took away some of the history aspects of the original installation, which is kind of disappointing.  Plus there doesn’t seem to be an upper level view which is accessible anymore."
Century Gardens,Mugdho Aosaf,5,A open park right next to LRT and hosts summer concerts
Century Gardens,Khaled Hasan,4,Small nice park in the core of DT. Fountains and flowers make a great combination.
Century Gardens,Sandee Jette,5,The makeover is beautiful! It looks like a completely different park now. I will probably visit more often now 😊 (The goose pic is from a couple of weeks ago.  I didn't see any today)
Weaselhead Flats Natural Environment Park,Artemii Plekhanov,5,"It is my favorite park in Calgary. It's a really huge piece of forest full of birds, animals, and other wildlife inhabitants. Despite the past history of this territory (it was an old military area), it's a truly unique place with fascinating landscapes views towards the river. You can use main trails with hard cover goods for bicycles or choose small paths. Each visit here is a special story, that's why I so love this park."
Weaselhead Flats Natural Environment Park,Brian Anderson,5,"Weaselhead was weaselfantastic! Beautiful scenery, lush paths! After a long day at the coal factory, I gotta say, I’m beat! But a walk through here filled me with the burning hot energy of a thousand suns being punched into basketball hoop. Swish. Nothing but PARK! It’s amazing. I saw a deer. That was nice. I saw a WATER SOMETHING I don’t know. It was in water, there’s lots of water! And don’t be afraid of the forest. The trees are trees. And if your spicy you’ll walk around the entire reservoir because you’re awesome and have legs made of thunder and a soul gleaming with ruby tinted lasers!"
Weaselhead Flats Natural Environment Park,Ly C.,5,Very wet after rain. Wear hiking/water resistant footwear.  Stunning views!
Weaselhead Flats Natural Environment Park,Jeremy,5,Great place to visit and walk around without leaving the city. Lots of paved paths but also some trails through the woods.
Weaselhead Flats Natural Environment Park,David Reeves,5,Great place to fish. Best time is at sunrise. Afternoons can have small crowds of people here. Easy access via bicycle with a couple big hills if you are coming from South Glenmore Park.
University Research Park,Roxanne Richards,5,"A tiny park (takes 5 minutes to walk around it) but its so cute! Words can't describe how adorable it is. So many birds around here especially ducks. Has a bit of everything; (tiny) grassy field, trees, pond, fountain, playground, exercise equipment, and a little shelter pavilion. Gets pretty busy despite its size in the summer but it's still lovely."
University Research Park,Christine Maurette,5,"Super cute park with  lake, fountain and stream.  The all metal.exercise equipment is really interesting! There is a station for vaulting, a station for chip ups, a station for leg lifts and a station for measuring how high you jump. The paths are paved.  Totally can see which areas are popular for Pokemon go by the number of people milling around with their phones!"
University Research Park,Dinesh Purohit,5,It’s peaceful and quite place. Children can play in children park which is available here . Man and boys can do exercise which is available too. Awesome tree’s
University Research Park,Akeru Gin,5,Great park for outside workout. Those stations are fun to do physical exercises. There is a small playground for children too.
University Research Park,aij leg,4,"The entire area is going to go through major upheaval looking for the map proposed changes it takes bit to figure out. The essential areas the duck pond with the Pagoda, should be safe!? It would be really sad, if they replace that with say a Stuckey's or an Arby's 🙄🙄🙄."
Banff Trail Park,Carlos Alberto Miranda,4,"Beautiful place, with a great park, and the place zone is quite good, I used to go with my child."
Banff Trail Park,Retoured,4,"I was forced out of Hidden Valley and had to move here. I had pretty low expectations for a community centre here because it’s further in the city and i’m not used to being this close in, but i was a bit surprised because i was wrong about that. I’ll start off by saying the playground is pretty high in quality, my sister loves it, and it’s a nice little spot that’s pretty accessible in the lower half of the community, capitol hill and the lower areas. There’s a really open field on a hill for basic sports with a family member. I noticed right by that was a small garden, and while i didnt get a good look at it, the things in there are very nice. There’s a hockey rink here too, for well, hockey. I enjoy my time spent in here and I would recommend showing up if you want to do some outdoor activities in a large open space."
Banff Trail Park,Fredward Clamington,5,"I hope the area never changes !
Fix the old homes stop ripping them down!"
Banff Trail Park,Marilynn Barnes,2,I wouldn't consider this a park it's more of a garden for people
Banff Trail Park,Craig Jacobs,4,"Skated on the community association maintained rink today (Sunday) and we had a good time. Not busy, we had it to ourselves for about 40mins. Full boards, two nets. A few pretty decent divets in the ice so it looks like they might only flood it once a week. Plenty of street parking around it."
Millenium Park,Chris England,5,"This park has a nice big open green space where they hold concerts and events.  The skate park is great and offers a variety of terrain for all skill levels.  My 8 year old enjoys bringing his bike here to ride in the morning before it becomes too busy.  There can be a few rough looking individuals hanging around, but they tend to keep to themselves."
Millenium Park,Ehab Kardouh,5,"This is a wonderful park and I was lucky finding it and visiting it today. It's a large, large and beautiful area full of flowers but only few seats.

Maybe I will be happier if there is an additional number of seats, but it's not an issue as you will discover that it's better to walk there and enjoy other activities rather than only sitting.

There are two areas to do activities. First one is a basketball playground where you can play with your friends, but you should bring your own basket ball for sure.

Second one is a skateboard playground. Actually, it's a large area, so if you like skating, then it's the destination that you should consider visiting soon.

I would suggest you to bring bottles of water with you as you will enjoy staying here for a long time and do many activities.

Finally, I took a lot of pictures to show everyone how this park looks like. I recommend everyone to visit this park whenever you want to enjoy walking, skating and playing basketball."
Millenium Park,Ryan Ducharme,5,Locally known as mills. Great part. A little sketchy after dark. With recent repairs by 5.0 solutions this park is very rideable! Highly recommend
Millenium Park,Bethanie Tillett-Wair,5,"I normally go there in the summer time when there's fairs and concerts , this weekend was no exception the Carifest parade ended there. Food trucks lot of tent ⛺️ and trees for shading. I had a great time and the weather was wonderful.  Blue skies and sunny days 🌞"
Millenium Park,Steve B,5,"Huge park. Lots of great lines. Tons of structures, bowls, rails, stairs, etc.. Was not very busy when we were there. Could use a little bit of a clean up. Over all, really great."
Humpy Hollow Park,Mukesh Ambaliya,5,"Love it, Enjoy swings.....!!"
Humpy Hollow Park,Wyatt Hollett,5,Gotta love the swings at the humpy hollow!
Humpy Hollow Park,Emmeline Johanson,5,Love the swings
Humpy Hollow Park,Chris Cousineau,4,Check the new art!
Humpy Hollow Park,Petri Dish,3,Sturdy swings
Harmony Park,Pardeep Sooch,4,"For a Downtown Park, this place is a hidden gem. You can park in the underground parking lot, and have easy access to street level for anything that you need (it’s right next to the core, and a stones throw away from China Town.

My only issue would be with the cleanliness of certain areas, but that’s to be expected in a park downtown. The parking lot also does not offer in and out privileges after you’ve paid."
Harmony Park,Theresa Valera,5,"Harmony Park downtown provides an excellent escape for a refreshing lunch break. The vibrant greenery and welcoming atmosphere make it an ideal spot to recharge, offering a delightful combination of outdoor tranquility and culinary enjoyment."
Harmony Park,Andrew Sher,5,"Easy to get in and out, clean, warm.  Easy to use pay station  Currently discount on parking weekends"
Harmony Park,Kay C,5,This park has a fabulous green space and a small gated playground in the northwest corner of the park that many don't even know is there. Around 9:30 - 11:30 it is often busy with daycares and school groups. Any other time you go the park is not very busy. The Suncore and Bow towers offer a lot of shade so even on a hot day this park is a cool spot to play!
Harmony Park,Tanjina Sharmin,4,Small but beautiful place. It’s missing some seasonal flowers.
Buckmaster Park,Linju John,4,A calm park in the heart of southwest area.Really beautiful park with play area and trees.Recently renovated with comfortable chairs and sitting area.
Buckmaster Park,sanjanaa venkat,5,"Quiet park for a walk! The surroundings is beautiful and you even have multiple benches. The grass is maintained well, so you can have a small picnic if you are in the neighborhood. Also you can bring your mat to do yoga in a beautiful space. The park has a small basketball play area. The park is not busy always and you can have a peaceful walk or a picnic"
Buckmaster Park,Olena Lena,5,"quiet, peaceful park, have a nice time on a picnic or play ball."
Buckmaster Park,John Manzo,5,"I didn't see a point to the renovations, but stumbled on then today (6 Dec 2023) while walking through Bankview and love them!"
Buckmaster Park,Amanda Taha,1,"This used to be a beautiful park. But then they built a playground and now instead of birdsong all you hear is children screeching all hours of the day, there's garbage everywhere, and the community garden at the top of the hill has gotten trashed a few times from kids playing it in. Such a shame."
Egert's Park,James C.,5,I really like this park a lot cuz I like the fact that it has a paved bike trail. And at the same time just an off-leash park you can take your dog. It's very quiet it's not easy to get into because he got to know how to get to it from the right community.
Egert's Park,Sandra Anderson,4,Lovely place for a stroll with a friend in the middle of a quiet neighborhood.
Egert's Park,Brandie Sunley,5,Beautiful park with a few stands of mature trees. Great downtown views.
Egert's Park,Ronie Wallace,5,Beautiful park for the whole family to enjoy including the family pets.
Egert's Park,D m,5,Excellent people . Very friendly dog owners . Everyone in control of their dogs and well matured dogs .
Splash Park,lionel isiaka,5,"I recently visited the Splash Park in Calgary, and it was an absolute blast! This water park is the perfect spot for families looking to beat the summer heat. The variety of water features, including sprinklers, fountains, and splash pads, ensures that kids of all ages have plenty to enjoy.

The park is well-maintained and clean, with ample seating and shaded areas for parents to relax while keeping an eye on their little ones. The staff was friendly and attentive, ensuring that all safety protocols were followed.

One of the standout features was the spacious layout, allowing plenty of room for children to play without feeling crowded. Additionally, the park offers accessible facilities, making it inclusive for everyone to enjoy.

Overall, the Splash Park in Calgary is a fantastic destination for a fun and refreshing day out. Highly recommended for families and anyone looking to cool off during the hot summer months!"
Splash Park,Nikki Spence,5,"Smaller location and very little shade, however, has a lovely little grassy area and lots of spray locations for the kids to play at. Bring your guns lol it's fun to have a community water war 😆 🤣"
Splash Park,Svitlana Jones (Sveta),5,"Great, cozy spray park. Very popular. Surrounded by lush grass to sit on, tall trees for partial shade and amid blooming flower beds."
Splash Park,Ruth Okafor,4,"Loved the experience.
It was a long wait to get in (capacity issue due to covid) as I was on the the queue for about an hour. It would have been awesome if there are other play equipments for the children to compliment the water play."
Splash Park,Michael Murray,5,"Great splash park fathers day to labour day 9 to 9. No dogs in the fence but allowed outside. Sunny and hot in the evenings not sure about the am. Tennis courts are beside the splash park and share the parking. Canmore park, triwood community center, are just divided by a road. Canmore park has the bike park to the east end."
Barb Scott Park,Olena Ov,5,I like this place on winter time. My daughter skates there ⛸️  And I'm warming myself by the fire.
Barb Scott Park,Olivia,3,"Nice and wide open. Sort of strange that there's nothing in the middle... It's just sort of there. I'm sure there's events sometimes, but while I was there it was empty. The benches surrounding the park are well built with minimal graffiti, but there's no backs on them!

I'm disabled and found it very uncomfortable to not be able to sit back and enjoy the sunshine.

Someone brought their dog and began throwing a frisbee off leash. There's NO signage saying not to do that.

There was a baby learning to walk, some people sitting on the grass having a picnic and an older couple walking the sidewalk circle. This dog (no matter how well behaved) could've had an issue -- been scared or had some other issue-- and it would've been a large issue.

I recommend signage is posted.
I felt uncomfortable.

The sidewalk was perfectly smooth and so there were a lot of e-scooters around there practicing around and around."
Barb Scott Park,Chass (King stich),4,I take my dog there every night he really enjoys the grass. I enjoy walking around the park and all the peace it brings to me
Barb Scott Park,Martha Hergert,3,Nice place to skate in winter and rest on a park bench in summer.
Barb Scott Park,Veep Peep,4,"Handy and pleasant for the inner city.  Nice place to hang.  That weird sculpture grows on you.
I hate the concrete oval path!  Why not more green space?  There are already sidewalks nearby.  When I asked the city council before it was built they said 99% of people liked the idea, except for me.  73 people responded to the survey."
Lindsay Park,David Reeves,4,"A nice park that is not very large close to downtown.  Lots of pathways for walking, biking or rollerblading.  Many squirrels that are not afraid of people at all as I am sure people feed them all the time. Personally I wish people would not feed the wildlife as it only hurts them in the long run. All in all a nice little park to spend a few hours enjoying nature in the heart of the city."
Lindsay Park,Don. J.,4,"A great park near the MNP Sports Center, with play equipment, bike trails, walking paths and picnic seating with loads of shaded spots to stop at. In the early mornings there are loads of rabbits out to brighten your (or your children's) day."
Lindsay Park,Scott Lonseth,5,"Amazing park! River, playground, bike paths & disc golf! MNP fitness center is also a fantastic aquatic & fitness facility😀"
Lindsay Park,Mukesh Ambaliya,5,Back to Nature experience..... Love it.... Must visit place in calgary down town....
Lindsay Park,Kay C,5,This is a great little park tucked in behind the Repsol Centre along the Elbow River. A great place to go for a walk and see all kinds of small animals or visit the playground. It is nicely shaded on a hot day and there are lots of little picnic tables and benches scattered around the park for a picnic.
Valleyview Park,Jesse Dickie,5,"This park is definitely my wife and dog's favorite. My wife gets scared eaisly, and our dog is reactive to others bigger dogs, so they need plenty of on-leash areas to run with a long lead in populated areas, which this park provides. We also enjoy the beautiful views at this park. Until 8:30 pm, there are many kids, families, and dogs around, but we have found several ways to avoid them, which we appreciate. We like how there is always parking and it's a great alternative than walking in 17th sketchy neighborhood."
Valleyview Park,Quynh Le,5,"A very nice multi-function park for family & kids hang out. There are three different nice playgrounds, grass football field, beach volleyball, great trails surrounded for a sparkling city-view night and day. A good place to gather for group's sports & picnic, stroll or biking.."
Valleyview Park,Julia Holova,5,"very nice park! there are toilets and places to change clothes, everything is clean. I recommend!

the entrance is free"
Valleyview Park,Ziera Bolduc,5,"Just love this hidden gem. There are volleyball courts, a baseball diamond, a gated toddler park with a spray center, pathways that run in all directions with great views of the west including downtown. A pond with beautiful small waterfalls and areas close by with benches. A larger playground for the older kids with disc swings(that fit many kiddos), balance ring, swing bars, and a climbing centre. One of my kids favourite!"
Valleyview Park,Danielle Pike,3,This is an okay splash park. It's great for small children like 5 and under in my opinion...the splash park isn't that big but for small children it's great and works well!!! There is also a playground right next to it on both sides and this makes for a great outing for the family.  It does get a bit crowded between 2pm and 4pm and because it isn't a very big splash park it gets a little overwhelming.  But my 2 and a half year old son doesn't seem to mind at all he just loves running and playing with everyone. LOL there is a lifeguard on duty there the past two times I visited so I don't know if they are there all times or specific times. There are bathrooms and changing rooms to which is nice and very clean!!!
City of Calgary - Tobogganing and sledding - Confederation Park,Canada WithKids,5,"The Lions' Festival of Lights was a magical experience, especially on opening night. 🌟 The countdown to 6 pm for the first lighting of the season, accompanied by breathtaking fireworks, set the festive tone. 🎆 Tim Hortons' generous donation of free hot chocolate and cookies added a delightful touch. ☕🍪

While the opening night lacked enough snow for tobogganing, the promise of returning in the snow adds to another fun event for the kids in the near future.
The bridge and walk-through area showcased a spectacular display of Christmas lights, creating a winter wonderland. ❄️✨

The concert on opening night contributed to the festive atmosphere, making it a jolly and joyful start to the holidays. 🎶 The combination of dazzling lights, seasonal treats, and entertainment made the Lions' Festival of Lights a must-visit for anyone seeking a magical Christmas experience. 🎄

Be sure to make it to opening night if you missed it this year.

City of Calgary - Tobogganing and sledding - Confederation Park,park jihye,5,Kid loves this place. Christmas decorations are perfect. And sledding place too.
City of Calgary - Tobogganing and sledding - Confederation Park,Jose Diaz,5,Great place to go tobagganing and to admire the light display during the Lions Festival of Lights. Finding somewhere to park can sometimes be challenging.
City of Calgary - Tobogganing and sledding - Confederation Park,Ebby,4,This place becomes magical during Christmas season. The park is all lit up and you can sled and skate during winter.
City of Calgary - Tobogganing and sledding - Confederation Park,Paul Colangeli,5,The kids love this place! The hill is not too steep. The lights and music make for a great winter wonderland experience. I’m so glad they opened this area up these past few years. As a kid I was only able to enjoy it from 14th street. The Lions club does a fantastic job! Keep it up! Calgary needs more of this.
Pixel Park,Jon Chamberlain,5,"Lovely little park in the centre of town.

We just discovered they had a dog park there so took our puppy to scope it out. It wasn’t long before a few dogs about 100 pounds heavier than her were there so we had to put her back on a leash. Probably a bit too small to separated into sections. All the same, very cool spot."
Pixel Park,Levi Switzer,5,It’s such a cool design for a skatepark/plaza. Only thing missing is a flatbar!
Pixel Park,Red Forever,1,I never saw such ugly park in my life. Dirty and depressing.
Pixel Park,Brendan Harris (Virtual Tour Calgary),1,"Impark was the worst operator to partner with on the parking here.
EV parking stalls have gas cars parked in them. No phone number around to call for a tow."
Pixel Park,Kine Patty,4,"Cute skate park (nothing huge), washrooms and free EV parking. Otherwise it's 4$/hr, 8$/2hrs"
Green Park,No longer using,5,"This is a quiet, serene, beautifully kept city park.  We walk here frequently.  There are very few people in this park, which is a shame because the area is so well kept and the park itself is beautiful.  We are on a quest to visit as many walkable dog friendly parks as possible.  This is my favourite smaller city park."
Green Park,Lane,5,"This park has a good outdoor rink in winter.  Two ice surfaces, area with benches that is usually shovelled, low-rise nets for shinny."
Green Park,Ross MacTyr,5,Great park space with a playground and enough open green space to play Frisbee or other outdoor games. Definitely worth going to for a nice picnic or break.
Green Park,Jehanzaib Syed,1,It's a small community park with seedy creepy vibe...wouldn't take my kids if it's late or if there are no other families
Green Park,Jeffrey KABAN,5,Went to skate and play a little hockey. We cleared half the ice and had a great time.
