## Overview

In many cities, public engagement and feedback collection are crucial to drive data-driven improvements. However, traditional survey methods often lead to low participation, survey fatigue, and difficulties for users with disabilities or limited digital literacy. Our project aims to tackle these challenges with a state-of-the-art platform that harnesses AI and voice technologies to streamline survey participation and extract actionable insights from public data.

## Problem Statement

Public engagement in decision-making processes is often hindered by tedious survey methods, low participation rates, and accessibility barriers. Traditional surveys require users to manually fill out lengthy forms, leading to survey fatigue and disengagement. Many individuals, including those with disabilities or limited digital literacy, struggle to contribute effectively. As a result, valuable insights from the community remain underutilized, limiting data-driven improvements.

Additionally, user-generated reviews on platforms like Google Maps contain rich, unstructured feedback, but cities and organizations lack efficient ways to analyze and extract meaningful insights from this data. For example, Calgaryâ€™s parks receive thousands of online reviews, but the city currently has no streamlined method to automate sentiment analysis and use this feedback for park improvements. By failing to leverage modern AI-driven solutions, decision-makers miss critical public opinions, resulting in inefficient planning and resource allocation.

There is a growing need for a more inclusive, engaging, and intelligent feedback system that makes surveys effortless, enhances accessibility, and extracts insights from public data to drive impactful changes.
